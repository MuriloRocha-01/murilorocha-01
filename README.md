Full Stack Developer | information System

## Hi, I'm Murilo, a Full Stack developer.I create responsive and user-friendly interfaces using JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. With a background in design and an interest in fullstack development, I like to turn ideas into simple and functional web projects. This is where I share what I'm learning and building as I grow in tech.
